# Cloud Web Application for XYZ-University

This is a cloud-based **Student Records Web Application** built on AWS as part of my AWS Academy Capstone Project

It powers a student admissions system and showcases my ability to design and deploy secure, scalable cloud architectures using core AWS services.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](architecture/architecture-diagram.jpeg)

The app runs in:
- **2 public subnets** for EC2 web servers
- **2 private subnets** for the RDS database
- A **load balancer** distributes traffic between EC2 instances
- **Secrets Manager** securely provides DB credentials
- The app was installed using a **user data script** at instance launch
